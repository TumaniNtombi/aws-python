# **Python Conditional Input Lab**

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use **conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to respond to user input. The script is interactive and allows the user to make choices about shipping a package and purchasing stationery items.

---

## **Description**

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Asks the user if they need to **ship a package**.
   - If the user enters `yes`, it confirms assistance.
   - If the user enters `no`, it politely ends the interaction.

2. Asks the user which **stationery item** they want to buy: `stamps`, `envelope`, or `copy`.
   - Responds according to the user's choice.
   - Handles invalid input gracefully by prompting the user to enter a valid option.

## **Python Concepts Covered**

- **Input from the user** using `input()`.
- **Conditional statements** with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **String manipulation** using `.lower()` to handle case-insensitive input.
- **Basic program flow control**.

---

## **Example Usage**

Run the script using:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
