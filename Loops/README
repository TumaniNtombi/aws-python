# **Python Guess the Number Lab**

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of **while loops**, **conditional statements**, and **user input** in Python. The program is an interactive **number guessing game** where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

---

## **Description**

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Introduces the user to the game with a welcome message and rules.  
2. Generates a random number between 1 and 10 using the `random` module.  
3. Prompts the user to guess the number until the correct guess is made.  
4. Provides feedback after each guess:  
   - Correct guess → congratulatory message and ends the loop.  
   - Incorrect guess → prompt to try again.

## **Python Concepts Covered**

- **Random number generation** with `random.randint()`.  
- **While loops** to repeat actions until a condition is met.  
- **Conditional statements** (`if`, `else`) to evaluate guesses.  
- **User input** and type conversion using `int()`.  
- **String formatting** with `.format()` for dynamic output messages.
